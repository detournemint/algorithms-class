//1.4.34 Hot or cold. Your goal is to guess a secret integer between 1 and N. 
//You repeatedly guess integers between 1 and N. After each guess you learn 
//if your guess equals the secret integer (and the game stops). Otherwise, you 
//learn if the guess is hotter (closer to) or colder (farther from) the secret 
//number than your previous guess. Design an algorithm that finds the secret 
//number in at most ~2 lg N guesses. Then design an algorithm that finds the 
//secret number in at most ~ 1 lg N guesses.
